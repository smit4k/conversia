# Privacy Policy for Conversia

Effective Date: Jun 12, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how **Conversia**, a Discord bot developed and maintained by [smit4k](https://github.com/smit4k), handles data while operating on Discord servers.

## 1. Data Collection

Conversia only collects minimal data required to function properly within Discord:

### What We Collect

- **User IDs**: For context in commands and temporary session handling
- **Message content**: Only when explicitly submitted to a command (e.g., file conversion)
- **File attachments**: Temporarily used for conversion purposes

### What We **Don't** Collect

- No direct messages are read or stored
- No message history is accessed or retained
- No persistent tracking of user activity is performed

## 2. Data Storage

- **No permanent storage**: All files and message data are processed in memory and discarded immediately after the operation completes.
- **No database or external logging** is used for storing user input or file content.

## 3. Use of Data

All collected data is used **solely** for executing the commands requested by the user, such as converting a file format or generating metadata.

## 4. Third-Party Services

Conversia does not share any user data with third-party services or external APIs beyond Discord itself.

If self-hosted, any changes you make to data handling are your responsibility.

## 5. Your Rights

As a user:

- You can remove the bot from your server at any time.
- You may contact the maintainer for clarification on how your data is handled.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Updates will be committed to the GitHub repository with a clear changelog.
